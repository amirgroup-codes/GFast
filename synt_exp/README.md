# GFast synthetic experiments

## Running GFast

To run GFast, run:

```console
sh synth_exp.sh
```

`synth_exp.sh` will call `run_test_samples_vs_nmse.py` to run the experiments for GFast, and `run_test_samples_vs_nmse_nr.py` to run the experiments for NR-GF

## Description of files

**synt_src/:** necessary files to run GFast

## Description of the synt_results folder

**synt_results/:** stores all results generated by q-sft and GFast, plus a CSV containing all the results. Below is a brief description of files that are present if you go into each folder inside `q{q}_n{n}_uniform_S{sparsity}_snr{snr}/`:
- **test/:** unused for experiments
- **train/:** contains all samples used to recover Fourier coefficients

In addition to the CSVs provided, we provide the results folders for each experiment in the figshare data repository under accession code [28414232](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/GFast/28414232).

For GFast, each folder is labelled as `iter{i}_delta{delta}_b{b}_perm{p}` where `i` is the iteration number, `delta` is the number of alphabets that aren't present from the original q-SFT function, `b` is the subsampling dimension, and `p` is the number of permutations used to manipulate the subsampling patterns.

For NR-GFast, each folder is labelled as `iter{i}_delta{delta}_b{b}_d{d}}` where `i` is the iteration number, `delta` is the number of alphabets that aren't present from the original q-SFT function, `b` is the subsampling dimension, and `d` is the number of repeats.
- Due to file size limitations, we only upload the results for `iter0`, `b=5`, and `d=20` across all NR-GFast experiments, and leave a CSV with the full results. We recommend running the NR-GFast experiments for yourself to get all the files.
